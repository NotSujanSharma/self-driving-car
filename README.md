## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Neural Network AI** - Self-learning car behavior
- 🛣️ **Dynamic Road Generation** - Procedural road layouts
- 🚦 **Traffic Simulation** - Realistic traffic patterns
- 🎮 **Interactive Controls** - Manual override capabilities
- 📊 **Real-time Visualization** - Neural network decision making
- 🎨 **Smooth Animations** - CSS-powered visual effects
- 📱 **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NotSujanSharma/self-driving-car.git
   cd self-driving-car
   ```

2. **Open in browser**
   ```bash
   # Simply open index.html in your preferred browser
   open index.html
   ```

3. **Start driving!**
   - Watch the AI learn to navigate traffic
   - Use arrow keys for manual control
   - Adjust AI parameters in real-time

## 🎮 Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` | Accelerate |
| `↓` | Brake/Reverse |
| `←` | Turn Left |
| `→` | Turn Right |
| `Space` | Toggle AI Mode |
| `R` | Reset Simulation |

## 🧠 How It Works

The self-driving car uses a neural network to make driving decisions:

1. **Sensors** - Ray casting for obstacle detection
2. **Neural Network** - Processes sensor data
3. **Decision Making** - Outputs steering and acceleration
4. **Learning** - Genetic algorithm for improvement

### Architecture

```
Sensors → Neural Network → Controls → Car Movement

    └─── Feedback Loop ←────────┘
```
